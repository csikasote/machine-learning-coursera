# Machine Learning - [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)

This is my Python re-implementation of the programming exercises in the classic Machine Learning course offered by Stanford University on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). The course is taught by AI's renowned researcher and teacher, Prof. Andrew Ng.

The programming exercises are outlined as follows:

- [Programming Exercise 1: Linear Regression](ex1)
- [Programming Exercise 2: Logistic Regression](ex2)
- [Programming Exercise 3: Multi-class classification & Neural Networks](ex3)
- [Programming Exercise 4: Neural Network Learning](ex4)
- [Programming Exercise 5: Regularized Linear regression & Bias vs. Variance](ex5)
- [Programming Exercise 6: Support Vector Machines](ex6)
- [Programming Exercise 7: K-Means Clustering and PCA](ex7)
- [Programming Exercise 8: Anomaly Detection & Recommender Systems](ex8)
